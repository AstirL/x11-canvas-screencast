Note: The player uses an AJAX request to load the example script.  If you're
trying to view this page through a file:// URL, then the page is likely not to
load due to same-origin security restrictions in your browser.  With Chrome,
you can (temporarily) relax the restrictions using the
--allow-file-access-from-files command-line option, which allows any page from
a file:// URL to read any file on your local file system that your account is
able to access.  For other browsers, you will want to view the page via HTTP.
